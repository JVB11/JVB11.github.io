While I was a teaching assistant for the courses of 'Natuurkunde met elementen van Wiskunde I & II' I co-developed a [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.google) Jupyter notebook (in Dutch).

This notebook was constructed with the aim of familiarizing students with the use of computers for the visualization of physical processes (using Python).
To do so, we asked them to simulate a basic experiment in mechanics: what happens when an object falls or is launched (from a certain height) and how does its trajectory look like.

It was great to see many students take their first steps in learning how to use Python, and applying it to a problem they had previously only worked out with paper & pen!
