> After a year-long break due to my long research stay at the California Institute of Technology (as mentioned on my CV), I resumed my work as a teaching assistant for this course for 1 more academic year (2022-2023).

The title of this course can be translated into English as 'Physics with elements of mathematics I' (taught in the first semester).
It is an introductory physics courses for the first-year students in the bachelor of science in pharmaceutical sciences at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), which is taught in Dutch.[^1]

We started out by refreshing the students' knowledge of (Belgian) secundary education-level mathematics.
Following this introductory chapter, we taught the students the typical introductory physics topics, such as Newtonian mechanics, waves, and the basics of thermodynamics, electrostatics, quantum mechanics and diffusion (among others); with an emphasis on linking physical laws with the pharmaceutical sciences.

[^1]: As I was a native speaker of Dutch and a PhD student in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at KU Leuven, I was not eligible to become a teaching assistant for a course taught in English (at the master level, with astronomy-related topics).
