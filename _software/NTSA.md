This computational framework was originally developed to detect resonances among the frequencies of stellar oscillations, in order to select targets for theoretical modeling.
Its use for this application is highlighted in [Van Beeck et al. (2021)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/11/aa41572-21/aa41572-21.html), where we specifically looked for three-oscillation resonances in variable stars of spectral type B[^1] that fuse hydrogen isotopes in their cores.

An article describing the generic computational framework is to be made.
When using (part of) this code, you should therefore cite the application article, [Van Beeck et al. (2021)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/11/aa41572-21/aa41572-21.html).[^2]
