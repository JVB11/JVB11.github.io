The theoretical modeling of stellar vibrations - also known as stellar oscillations - has been the focus of my work for a large part of my (short academic) career.
To perform this theoretical modeling I developed a computational framework, [AE Solver](https://github.com/JVB11/AESolver), that aims to simulate the (non-linear) energy exchange among different stellar oscillations in order to model their amplitudes in, for example, observed photometric light curves (of variable stars).
The theoretical formalism that forms the basis for this computational framework is described in [Van Beeck et al. (2024)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/07/aa48369-23/aa48369-23.html).
When using (part of) this code, you should therefore cite that article.[^1]
