## Non-linear Coupling Model


## Modeling Potential


## Relevant Publications & Software

### Software

Check out the [AESolver](https://github.com/JVB11/AESolver) computational framework that we developed for the purpose of simulating (resonant) non-linear mode three-mode coupling in rotating stars.
A succinct description of this software suite is given on the [relevant software page](https://jvb11.github.io/software/AESolver/).
