I am a theoretical astrophysicist who investigates the dynamical processes happening inside stars by studying the waves in their interior.
I became an [asteroseismologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroseismology) during my PhD and 3-month post-doctoral associate position at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), under the watchful/supervisory eyes of my promoters [Prof. Conny Aerts](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/staff/conny-aerts), [Prof. Tim Van Hoolst](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00012864) and my co-supervisor [Prof. Dominic Bowman](https://dbowman234.github.io).
From the first of February, 2025, I will be joining the [Theory and Observations of Stars group](https://www.h-its.org/research/tos/) at the [Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](https://www.h-its.org), as a postdoctoral research associate.

I am interested in/excited by what makes stars 'tick': what are causes of stellar [variability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_star) (at different stages of [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution)) and how is this observed, what is the link with their [winds/outflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind)/[activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_magnetic_field#Surface_activity), how are waves/oscillation modes generated in their interior and how do they (stars in [multiple star systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system#Multiple_star_systems) and multiple oscillation modes) interact with each other, how can all of this knowledge be used to improve stellar [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_structure) models, and what does this imply for their evolution and [remnants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution#Stellar_remnants).
My work therefore spans different sub-fields of [asteroseismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroseismology), the study of waves/oscillation modes inside (variable) stars with the aim to constrain stellar structure and evolution models.
A word cloud containing [(unified) Astronomy thesaurus](https://astrothesaurus.org/thesaurus/alphabetical-browse/) keywords that describe my research is displayed on top of this page.
Additional information on my work can be found on my [research](https://jvb11.github.io/research) and [software](https://jvb11.github.io/software) pages.

In addition to my research I am excited by a lot of things in the broad and exciting field of astrophysics, developing software that is freely available for potential users ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)) in a variety of programming languages, certain fields of chemistry (astro/computational/theoretical/analytical), and [teaching](https://jvb11.github.io/teaching) students about the universe (i.e., teaching physics/chemistry).
On a more personal level, I am also excited by a variety of sports, glorious food, and enjoying great-looking locations on our planet with lovely company.
