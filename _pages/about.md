to my personal space on the web! 

I am currently a Research Associate in Asteroseismology at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), Belgium. I earned my B. Sc. and M. Sc. in Chemistry ('Chemie') from the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) and my M. Sc. and Ph. D. in Astronomy & Astrophysics from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/).

My work has been [published](https://jvb11.github.io/publications) in *Astronomy & Astrophysics*. The topic of my research is centered around asteroseismology, the study of waves inside (variable) stars to characterize the internal structure of stars so that theoretical models of their evolution (and structure) can be improved. I primarily focus my [research](https://jvb11.github.io/research) on the energy exchange among (gravity) waves propagating inside (variable) stars, referred to as non-linear mode coupling. In addition, some of my research papers discussed the influence of magnetic fields on gravity waves inside stars.<sup id="a1">[1](#fn1)</sup> 

[comment] # (I also maintain an active interest in (astro)chemistry and plasma physics and try to keep up with some of the recent advances within these field.)

I have [teaching](https://jvb11.github.io/teaching) experience in (generic) freshman university-level physics courses, and have been a tutor in chemistry / physics / mathematics at the secondary education level. I furthermore co-authored a Python exercise (in Dutch, my mother tongue) at the freshman (university) level that taught students how to visualize physical processes on their screens.

<sub><a name="fn1">1</a>: Note the difference between a gravity wave and a gravitational wave. Whereas the latter event ripples the space-time continuum and is created by highly energetic events such as the merger of a neutron star and a black hole, the former event is much less energetic and therefore can be detected in less energy-dense environments, such as the interior of a star (:slightly_smiling_face:). Gravity waves can also be found closer to our homes, in the form of waves propagating in the deep oceans of our planet Earth, and are driven by buoyancy. [â†©](#a1)</sub>
