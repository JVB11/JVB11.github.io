Welcome to my personal space on the web! 

I am currently a PhD student at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), Belgium, and a visiting student researcher (VSR) at [Caltech-TAPIR](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu), CA, US. I earned my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Chemistry ('Chemie') from the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) and my M.Sc. in Astronomy & Astrophysics from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/).

My work has been [published](https://jvb11.github.io/publications) in *Astronomy & Astrophysics*. My PhD topic is centered around asteroseismology, the study of waves inside (variable) stars to characterize how stars evolve, by improving current theoretical models. I primarily focus my [research](https://jvb11.github.io/research) on nonlinear interactions among (gravity) waves propagating inside (variable) stars. In addition, some of my research papers discussed the influence of magnetic fields on gravity waves inside stars.<sup id="a1">[1](#fn1)</sup> I also maintain an active interest in (astro)chemistry and plasma physics and try to keep up with some of the recent advances within these field. 

I have [teaching](https://jvb11.github.io/teaching) experience in (generic) freshman university-level physics courses, and have been a tutor in chemistry / physics / mathematics at the secondary education level. I furthermore co-authored a Python exercise at the freshman (university) level that taught students how to visualize physical processes on their screens.

<sub><a name="fn1">1</a>: Note the difference between a gravity wave and a gravitational wave. Whereas the latter event ripples the space-time continuum and is created by highly energetic events such as the merger of a neutron star and a black hole, the former event is much less energetic and therefore can be detected in less energy-dense environments, such as the interior of a star (:slightly_smiling_face:). Gravity waves can also be found closer to our homes, in the form of waves propagating in the deep oceans of our planet Earth, and are driven by buoyancy. [â†©](#a1)</sub>
