I am a theoretical astrophysicist who investigates the dynamical processes happening inside stars by studying the waves in their interior.
To do so, I was trained as an [asteroseismologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroseismology) during my PhD and 3-month Post-doctoral position at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), under the watchful/supervisory eyes of [Prof. Conny Aerts](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/staff/conny-aerts), [Prof. Tim Van Hoolst](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00012864) and [Prof. Dominic Bowman](https://dbowman234.github.io).

My work spans different sub-fields of asteroseismology, the study of waves/oscillation modes inside (variable) stars with the aim to constrain stellar structure and evolution.
While my latest theoretical work focused on the (non-linear) energy exchange among the oscillation modes, I have also worked on characterizing the influence of an internal stellar magnetic field on mode frequencies.
I do not shy away from more observationally oriented projects and have led a project to characterize the variability of a large sample of [slowly pulsating B stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_pulsating_B-type_star).
For more information on all this, please check out my [research](https://jvb11.github.io/research) and [software](https://jvb11.github.io/software) pages.

In addition to my research I am (easily) excited by (computational/plasma/theoretical) astrophysics as a whole, developing software that is freely available for potential users ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)) in a variety of computer languages, certain fields of chemistry (astro/computational/theoretical/analytical), and [teaching](https://jvb11.github.io/teaching) students about the universe (i.e., teaching physics/chemistry).
On a more personal level, I am also easily excited by a variety of sports, glorious food, and enjoying great-looking locations on our planet with lovely company.

**After an 3-month appointment as a post-doctoral research associate in Asteroseismology at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) I am ready to start a new adventure within stellar astrophysics. My CV may be downloaded on [this page](https://jvb11.github.io/cv) and contact details can be found in the dropdown menu (on mobile) or the navigation bar on the left of this page (on pc).**

<!-- I was a Research Associate in Asteroseismology at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), Belgium until December 2023, after having finished my Ph. D. in September 2023, and am now exploring opportunities to continue my research career. I earned my B. Sc. and M. Sc. in Chemistry ('Chemie') from the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) and my M. Sc. and Ph. D. in Astronomy & Astrophysics from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/). -->

<!-- My work has been [published](https://jvb11.github.io/publications) in *Astronomy & Astrophysics*. The topic of my research was centered around asteroseismology, which is the study of waves inside (variable) stars with the aim of characterizing the internal structure of stars so that theoretical models of their evolution and structure can be improved. I primarily focused my [research](https://jvb11.github.io/research) on the energy exchange among (gravity) waves propagating inside (variable) stars, which is also known as non-linear (gravity) mode coupling. In addition, some of my research papers discussed the influence of magnetic fields on gravity waves inside stars.<sup id="a1">[1](#fn1)</sup>  -->

<!-- In addition to asteroseismology, I am interested in a broad variety of topics that for example include (plasma/stellar) astrophysics, planetary sciences, applied mathematics (for a wide variety of purposes), astrochemistry, ... 
One could state that I take lifelong scientific learning (very) seriously, as I tend to enjoy reading research papers in a variety of scientific fields.
Any proposal for collaborative research within these or similar topics of interest is therefore welcome.<sup id="a2">[2](#fn2)</sup>  -->

<!-- I enjoyed [teaching](https://jvb11.github.io/teaching) in (generic) freshman university-level physics courses, and enjoyed having been a tutor in chemistry / physics / mathematics at the secondary education level. I furthermore co-authored a Python exercise (in Dutch, my mother tongue) at the freshman (university) level that taught students how to visualize physical processes.
By doing so, I hope to have (at least partially) contributed positively to the scientific formation of the next generation of scientists. -->

<!-- <sub><a name="fn1">1</a>: There is a difference between a gravity wave and a gravitational wave. Whereas the latter ripples the space-time continuum and is created by extremely energetic events such as the merger of a neutron star and a black hole, the former is much less energetic and therefore can be detected in less energy-dense environments, such as the interior of a star (:slightly_smiling_face:). Gravity waves can be found 'closer to home': some of the waves propagating in the deep oceans of our planet Earth are gravity waves, because they are restored by [buoyancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy).</sub>

<sub><a name="fn2">2</a>: Opportunities that allow me to branch out into a new reseach area are most welcome! Should you wish to contact me concering such an opportunity, you may find my contact details on the left of this web page.</sub> -->
