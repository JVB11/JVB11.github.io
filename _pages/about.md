I am a theoretical astrophysicist who investigates the dynamical processes happening inside stars by studying the waves in their interior.
To do so, I was trained as an [asteroseismologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroseismology) during my PhD and 3-month post-doctoral position at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), under the watchful/supervisory eyes of [Prof. Conny Aerts](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/staff/conny-aerts), [Prof. Tim Van Hoolst](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00012864) and [Prof. Dominic Bowman](https://dbowman234.github.io).

My work spans different sub-fields of [asteroseismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroseismology), the study of waves/oscillation modes inside ([variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_star)) stars with the aim to constrain stellar [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_structure) and [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution).
While my latest theoretical work focused on the (non-linear) energy exchange among the oscillation modes, I have also worked on characterizing the influence of an internal stellar magnetic field on mode frequencies.
I do not shy away from more observationally oriented projects and have led a project to characterize the variability of a large sample of [slowly pulsating B stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_pulsating_B-type_star).
For more information on all this, please check out my [research](https://jvb11.github.io/research) and [software](https://jvb11.github.io/software) pages.

In addition to my research I am (easily) excited by (computational/plasma/theoretical/planetary) astrophysics as a whole, developing software that is freely available for potential users ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)) in a variety of computer languages, certain fields of chemistry (astro/computational/theoretical/analytical), and [teaching](https://jvb11.github.io/teaching) students about the universe (i.e., teaching physics/chemistry).
On a more personal level, I am also easily excited by a variety of sports, glorious food, and enjoying great-looking locations on our planet with lovely company.

> **After a 3-month appointment as a post-doctoral research associate in Asteroseismology at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) I am ready to start a new astrophysical adventure.
