I am a theoretical astrophysicist who investigates the dynamical processes happening inside stars by studying the waves in their interior.
To do so, I was trained as an [asteroseismologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroseismology) during my PhD and 3-month post-doctoral position at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), under the watchful/supervisory eyes of [Prof. Conny Aerts](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/staff/conny-aerts), [Prof. Tim Van Hoolst](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00012864) and [Prof. Dominic Bowman](https://dbowman234.github.io).

My work spans different sub-fields of [asteroseismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroseismology), the study of waves/oscillation modes inside ([variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_star)) stars with the aim to constrain stellar [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_structure) and [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution) models.
I strive to research what makes stars 'tick': what are causes of stellar variability (at different stages of evolution) and how is this observed, what is the link with their [winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind)/[activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_magnetic_field#Surface_activity), how are oscillation modes generated in their interior and how do they (stars in [multiple star systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system#Multiple_star_systems) and multiple oscillation modes) interact with each other, how can all of this knowledge be used to improve stellar structure models, and what does this imply for their evolution and [remnants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution#Stellar_remnants).
For more information on my work that tackles some of these topics, please check out my [research](https://jvb11.github.io/research) and [software](https://jvb11.github.io/software) pages.

In addition to my research I am excited by astrophysics as a whole, developing software that is freely available for potential users ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)) in a variety of programming languages, certain fields of chemistry (astro/computational/theoretical/analytical), and [teaching](https://jvb11.github.io/teaching) students about the universe (i.e., teaching physics/chemistry).
On a more personal level, I am also excited by a variety of sports, glorious food, and enjoying great-looking locations on our planet with lovely company.
