I am a (theoretically oriented) asteroseismologist who is trained in astronomy & astrophysics, in addition to chemistry.
I have primarily worked on topics related to asteroseismology of intermediate-mass main sequence stars.
In future work, I would like to broaden the scope of my research (for example, by utilizing (magneto-)hydrodynamical simulations of stellar interiors for the purpose of understanding stellar oscillation mode selection).
