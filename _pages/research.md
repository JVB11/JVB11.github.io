I am a asteroseismologist/theoretical astrophysicist trained in chemistry and astrophysics.
I have primarily worked on topics related to asteroseismology of (single) intermediate-mass main sequence stars, but have also collaborated on analyses of tidally perturbed oscillations in eclipsing binaries and the age-dating of clusters using asteroseismology.

My interests are not limited to this subset of astrophysics and I would be eager to collaborate on topics in different sub-fields of astrophysics, chemistry and astronomy.
For example, my current interests range from the use of magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to employing various methods of variability detection to further some of my research goals.
