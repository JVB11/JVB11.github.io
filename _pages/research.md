I am a asteroseismologist/theoretical astrophysicist trained in chemistry and astrophysics.
I primarily work on topics related to asteroseismology of (single) intermediate-mass main sequence stars, but have also collaborated on analyses of tidally perturbed oscillations in eclipsing binaries and the age-dating of clusters using asteroseismology.

My interests are however not limited to this subset of astrophysics and I would be eager to collaborate/work on topics in different sub-fields of astrophysics and astronomy.
I am for example interested in the use of multi-dimensional simulations of stars using (magneto-)hydrodynamics to further some of my research goals (see e.g. [my research on non-linear oscillation mode coupling](https://jvb11.github.io/research/nonlinear_coupling/)).
