I am a [asteroseismologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroseismology)/theoretical astrophysicist trained in chemistry and astronomy/astrophysics who is on a quest to create more realistic stellar ([structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_structure)) models for the entire [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution) track.
I have primarily worked on topics related to the asteroseismology of (single) [intermediate-mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star#Formation_and_evolution) [main sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence) stars, but have also collaborated on analyses of tidally perturbed oscillations in [eclipsing binaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star#Eclipsing_binaries) and the age-dating of [stellar clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_cluster) using asteroseismology.

While my latest theoretical work focused on the ([non-linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system)) energy exchange among the oscillation modes, I have also worked on characterizing the influence of an internal stellar magnetic field on oscillation mode frequencies.
I also do not shy away from more observationally oriented projects and have led a project to characterize the variability of a large sample of [slowly pulsating B stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_pulsating_B-type_star).

My interests are not limited to this subset of astrophysics and I would be eager to collaborate on topics in different sub-fields of astrophysics, chemistry and astronomy.
For example, I am currently intrigued by topics ranging from the use of ([magneto-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics))[hydrodynamical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics) simulations and the study of (slow) [chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) in astrophysics to employing various methods of variability detection to further some of my research goals.
