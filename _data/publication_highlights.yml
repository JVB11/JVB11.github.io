  imagedescription: Example of a [photometric light curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(astronomy)) of a [slowly pulsating B star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_pulsating_B-type_star), as measured by the [NASA Kepler space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_space_telescope).
  description: Variable stars exhibit (periodic) variations in their brightness, which can be tracked with long-term observations by telescopes ([photometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(astronomy))), resulting in so-called photometric light curves. [Harmonic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis) of these light curves is an established technique to retrieve the variable star's (intrinsic) oscillation mode frequencies. To characterize the energy exchange among these oscillation modes one should however also characterize their amplitudes (and phases).<br><br> In this work we created a framework that uses 5 different strategies to perform [harmonic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis), in order to track any systematics that occur when using a single (specific) strategy. Combining the outcomes of the different analyses led to a robust list of amplitudes, frequencies and phases of stellar oscillations for a sample of [slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_pulsating_B-type_star). Within that list, several resonant triads were identified (see [Van Beeck et al. 2024](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/07/aa48369-23/aa48369-23.html) for additional information), which indicates that [SPB stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_pulsating_B-type_star) are inherently non-linear oscillators.

  imagedescription: "Overview of interaction triads/networks: Orange circles indicate oscillations that naturally occur (i.e., are linearly driven) within the star (model), whereas purple squares indicate oscillations that would not be sustained (i.e., linearly damped) within the star without non-linear energy exchange."
  description: Asteroseismology, the study of stellar oscillations to improve our understanding of star evolution and structure, commonly relies on the measurement of precise oscillation frequencies obtained by applying harmonic analysis techniques to observed photometric light curves (typically observed by space telescopes such as the [NASA Kepler space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_space_telescope)). Such harmonic analyses not only characterize parameters additional to the mode frequency (i.e., mode amplitude and phase) but in some cases also show distinct signs of non-linear energy exchange among oscillations (e.g. [Van Beeck et al. 2021](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/11/aa41572-21/aa41572-21.html)).<br><br> In this work we therefore developed a theoretical and computational framework that simulates the (non-linear) energy exchange among three modes that (resonantly) interact (i.e., resonant triads). We found that utilizing amplitude ratio information may offer additional constraints for the modeling of stellar interiors.
