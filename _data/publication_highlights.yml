    description: Example of a photometric light curve of a [slowly pulsating B star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_pulsating_B-type_star), as measured by the [NASA Kepler space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_space_telescope).
  description: Variable stars exhibit (periodic) variations in their brightness, which can be tracked with long-term observations by telescopes ([photometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(astronomy))), resulting in so-called photometric light curves. [Harmonic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis) of these light curves is an established technique to retrieve the variable star's (intrinsic) oscillation mode frequencies. To characterize the energy exchange among these oscillation modes, which is important in unraveling the internal [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_structure) and the intrinsically linked [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution) of stars, one should however also characterize their amplitudes (and phases).<br><br> In this work we created a framework that uses 5 different strategies to perform [harmonic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis), in order to track any systematics that occur when using a single (specific) strategy. Combining the outcomes of the different analyses led to a robust list of amplitudes, frequencies and phases of stellar oscillation modes for a sample of [slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_pulsating_B-type_star). Within that list several resonant triads were identified, which indicates that [SPB stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_pulsating_B-type_star) are inherently non-linear oscillators (see [Van Beeck et al. 2024](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/07/aa48369-23/aa48369-23.html) for additional information).

    description: "Overview of triads of interacting oscillation modes: Orange circles indicate oscillation modes that naturally occur (i.e., are linearly [driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driven_oscillations)) within the star (model). Purple squares indicate oscillation modes that would not be sustained (i.e., linearly [damped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping)) within the star without non-linear energy exchange among the modes in the triad."
  description: [Asteroseismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroseismology), the study of stellar oscillation modes to improve our understanding of stellar [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution) and [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_structure), commonly relies on the measurement of precise oscillation mode frequencies. These frequencies are typically obtained by applying [harmonic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis) techniques to observed photometric light curves, which are for example observed by space telescopes such as the [NASA Kepler space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_space_telescope). Such [harmonic analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis) not only characterize parameters additional to the mode frequency (i.e., the mode amplitude and phase) but in some cases distinct signs of non-linear energy exchange among oscillations can also be picked up from their parameter values (see e.g., [Van Beeck et al. 2021](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/11/aa41572-21/aa41572-21.html)).<br><br> In this work we therefore developed a theoretical and computational framework that simulates the (non-linear) energy exchange among three modes that ([resonantly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance)) interact (i.e., resonant triads). We found that utilizing oscillation mode amplitude ratio information (of modes in resonant triads) may offer additional constraints when modeling stellar interiors.
